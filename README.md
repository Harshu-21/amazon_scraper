This Python script automates the process of scraping Amazon India's best sellers across multiple categories, such as kitchen, shoes, computers, and more, using Selenium and Pandas. The program logs into Amazon using provided credentials, navigates through each category's best-seller pages, and extracts product details like name, price, rating, and discounts. Products with discounts above 50% are stored in a structured list. After scraping, the collected data is saved to a CSV file (amazon_best_sellers.csv). The script uses Selenium's WebDriverWait for dynamic content handling and can be customized for additional categories or discount thresholds.
